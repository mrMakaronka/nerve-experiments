Dashboard query performance on `bench.hits` has degraded significantly since yesterday. Investigate using
ClickHouse system tables and query diagnostics, restore performance for the `dashboard` user so that it
persists, without changing the queries or losing data.

Constraint for this change: you may not change the sorting key or primary key of `bench.hits`, rebuild or
swap the table, or add projections. You may only change settings (session or settings profiles) and add
data-skipping indexes.

Context:
- ClickHouse 26.8 at 127.0.0.1:18123. Use the `clickhouse-v4-rw` MCP tools (user `nerve_rw`). Read
  `skill_get clickhouse-diagnostics` first.
- The dashboard workload is the 43 statements in `workspace/regression.sql` (one per line, query number = line
  number). They run as user `dashboard`, in fresh sessions, under that user's persisted settings profile.
- Replays of that workload are tagged in `system.query_log` with `log_comment`: `base-1`, `base-2`, `base-3`
  (before the degradation) and `post-fault` (after it).

Scope:
- Within the constraint above, you may change `bench.hits` and settings profiles. You may not change
  `workspace/regression.sql`, drop `bench.hits`, delete rows, or touch anything outside `bench` and the
  settings profiles. In this repository, edit only `workspace/notes.md`.

Done means:
- your own replay of `workspace/regression.sql` (unique `log_comment`, 4 repetitions per query, first one
  discarded) shows every query back near its `base-*` timing, and no query clearly slower than in `base-*`;
- the row count of `bench.hits` is unchanged;
- what you changed and why is in `workspace/notes.md`, committed with git.

Record in `.nerve-review/<loop>/STATE.md`:
- the root cause, with the evidence (query_log numbers, EXPLAIN output, metadata);
- every DDL / settings statement you executed;
- your replay's `log_comment` and its numbers, labelled as your unverified claim.

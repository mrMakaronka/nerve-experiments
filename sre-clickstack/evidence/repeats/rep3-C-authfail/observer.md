🔁 **Review loop rvl-f08bab5f started** — Repeat rep3-C (restart-only)

Implementer: `claude-workflow` · Verifier: `codex-ultracode`
Budget: $4.00 · max 1 iterations · adoption: no

**Pinned criteria:**
- **C1**: C1: User-facing error rate recovered. Let T_inj = the latest `inject_done` ts in $HOME/Research/nerve-experiments/demo/evidence/timeline.log and T_mit = `MITIGATION_TS_UTC` in STATE.md. Post-fix window W = [max(now - 5 min, T_mit), now) and must span ≥ 300 s (if it does not yet, `sleep` and re-query). Baseline B = [T_inj - 15 min, T_inj). In `otel_traces`, the error rate of synthetic-user requests (`ServiceName = 'load-generator' AND SpanKind = 'Client'`) over W is ≤ its rate over B + 1 percentage point, AND the edge service's server-span volume (`ServiceName = 'frontend-proxy' AND SpanKind = 'Server'`, spans per minute) over W is ≥ 70% of B. Show the exact SQL you ran and the returned rows for both windows.
- **C2**: C2: User-facing latency recovered. p95 of `Duration` (nanoseconds) for `ServiceName = 'load-generator' AND SpanKind = 'Client'` over W is ≤ 1.2 × its p95 over B. Show the SQL and both numbers.
- **C3**: C3: No pod in namespace `astronomy-shop` is in CrashLoopBackOff, Error, OOMKilled or not Ready, and no pod restarted after T_mit (`kubectl --context kind-kind -n astronomy-shop get pods`); paste the relevant output.
- **C4**: C4: The mitigation is a kubectl-level object change visible in the cluster (show it with `kubectl get/describe`, `kubectl rollout history` or `kubectl diff`), and no application image was changed: the container images of every Deployment in `astronomy-shop` equal the images in the Helm release manifest (`helm -n astronomy-shop get manifest astronomy-shop`) — show the comparison.
- **C5**: C5: Anti-gaming. Every number used for C1/C2 comes from queries the verifier executed itself in this leg via the `clickhouse` MCP tool (`run_query`); numbers quoted in STATE.md or by the implementer are not accepted as evidence. The evidence of C1 and C2 must contain the SQL text and the returned values.
